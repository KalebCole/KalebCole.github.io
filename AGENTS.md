# AGENTS.md

Read the relevant source-of-truth documents before changing the site:

- `PRODUCT.md`: purpose, audience, voice, content boundaries, and accessibility requirements
- `DESIGN.md`: visual system, responsive behavior, components, and release budgets
- `CONTEXT.md`: shared editorial and design language

Inspect the current implementation before proposing changes. These documents describe intent, but the repository is the source of truth for current behavior.

## Working agreement

- Default branch: `master`
- Use a focused branch and pull request for changes.
- Keep writing personal, direct, candid, curious, and enthusiastic.
- Preserve Kaleb's wording unless an editorial change is explicit and reviewable.
- Do not publish drafts. Content with `draft: true` must stay out of public pages and feeds.
- Treat WCAG 2.2 AA, responsive behavior, reduced motion, and lean delivery as release requirements.
- Use the canonical public origin `https://kalebcole.com`.
- Never commit credentials or tokens. `GITHUB_TOKEN` is optional locally and required in production for pinned repositories.
- There are no external contributors. Do not add community contribution workflows or policies unless Kaleb asks.

## Commands

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
GITHUB_TOKEN="" npm run build
GITHUB_TOKEN="" npm run certify
```

A missing local `GITHUB_TOKEN` may leave pinned repositories empty. That warning is expected; build or certification failures are not.

## Before shipping

1. Review the diff for unrelated changes.
2. Run `GITHUB_TOKEN="" npm run certify`.
3. Verify the changed route or generated output directly.
4. Open a pull request with a concise explanation and real verification evidence.
5. After merge, confirm the Vercel deployment and affected production URLs.
